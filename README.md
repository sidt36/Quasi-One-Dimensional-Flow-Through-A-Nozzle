This is a project which involves using the McCormack method to numerically compute the flow of a fluid through a converging diverging nozzle.(The project is implemented in both python and Matlab,however ->#{Python code broken, MATLAB code working}<-)

A complete documentation of the project is found in cfd_nozzle.pdf
